RSI = 100 â€“ 100 / (1 + RS)
RS = Average of periods which close up in price / Average of periods which go down in price
Normally the number of periods used is 14, but it is entirely up to the trader how many to use.

Generally, if the value is under 30, it indicates the asset has been oversold. On the flip side, if the value is over 70, it indicates the asset has been overbought.
